#In this class we’re going to look at how to work with APIs in RStudio

#################
## APIs & more ##
#################

#R is a versatile tool when it comes to data imports 
#It can handle data from a variety of sources

#One of the useful import packages is for working with APIs and is called httr
#Let's install it and look at its functionality
install.packages("httr")
library("httr")

#We're going to pull data from the European Court of Human Rights
#The data comes in an xml feed from the ECHR
#Let’s look at how we can pull the data down with the functions in the package

#Here’s an example of pulling data from the US data set data.gov website in the US
#You can get your own key directly from http://www.data.gov/developers/apis
# Data.gov Utility Rates API
sample2 <- GET(“http://api.data.gov/nrel/utility_rates/v3.json?api_key=sample_key&address=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway,+Mountain+View,+CA“)

## Large datasets & rio ##

#Another package that is invaluable for transforming data sets from one format to another is rio
#Let's install it and load it from the library
install.packages("rio")
library("rio")
